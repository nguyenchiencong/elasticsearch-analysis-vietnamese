## User guide

The plugin includes the `vi_analyzer` analyzer and `vi_tokenizer` tokenizer.

The `vi_analyzer` is built using the `vi_tokenizer` tokenizer, the `lowercase` and `stop` filter.

 The analyzer analyzes `"công nghệ thông tin Việt Nam"` into `"công nghệ thông tin"` and `"việt nam"` tokens.
